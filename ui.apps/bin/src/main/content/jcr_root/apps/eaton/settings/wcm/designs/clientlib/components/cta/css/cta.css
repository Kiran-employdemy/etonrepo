/** Base font-stack
* $customFonts are optional authored CSS variable font stacks
* @if statement is used because  when $customFonts is undefined, `var($customFonts)` results in `var(),...`,
* which throws off the font stack and will prevent the fallbacks from being applied.
* When a CSS variable is passed in, Sass is unable to determine if it has a value or not, only if it exists.
* For that reason, we define fallbacks in the var().
